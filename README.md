(Yes, I know it’s Python and not Java like we’ve learned so far)

This website is the culmination of BASIS Phoenix CSHS’s final project, where we design a website to showcase our honor society’s accomplishments and event participation!

What is CSHS?

CSHS stands for Computer Science Honor Society, and it is a nationwide organization that recognizes high school students who excel in computer science and are passionate about technology. It’s more than just a regular honor society; CSHS encourages leadership, service, and a love for computing and technology.

Members participate in coding events, outreach programs, and tech-related projects that make a real impact in the school and community. Whether you’re into programming, cybersecurity, or just curious about how tech shapes the world, CSHS is a place to grow, collaborate, and inspire others through computer science.

The BASIS Phoenix CSHS Chapter was founded in August 2024. Advised by our resident CS teacher, Ms. Yoo, this honor society aims to teach inducted students more about computer science, possible career paths arising from it, and how it can impact our futures.

In the 2024-2025 school year, we’ve had several key accomplishments in the Firebird CSHS Chapter:

Founded the school’s first Computer Science Honor Society.
Grew the club to 14 members in a single year.
Prepped students on how to approach USACO programming problems in Java.
Equipped students with resources to advance their CS education, such as the GitHub Student Developer Pack and Harvard’s CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course.
Culminated our website design and development knowledge through this feature website, showcasing our honor society, its accomplishments, and its members.

USACO
USACO is a yearly nation-wide competition with three classes: Silver. Gold, and Platinum. Many different coding languages are used in different competitions, and practice questions are given online. With each progressing league, more difficult challenges and questions are given. The USACO helps participants to sharpen their problem-solving skills, improve their college applications and provide opportunities for scholarships, pave a pathway to the International Olympiad in Informatics, and provides industry recognition and career benefits.

Coding Camp
Coding camp enable you to freely ask questions to the tutors and master any coding language you like! This camp happens over summer for those who are willing to not procrastinate and make their summer interesting and fun!

Competition is always a fantastic thing, and the computer industry is intensely competitive
